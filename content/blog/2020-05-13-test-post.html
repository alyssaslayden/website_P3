<p>This all started because of a very contentious debate about the attractiveness of various Star Wars characters. I decided to use the Star Wars dataset to settle things once and for all. I cleaned up the dataset, so that it just contained the male characters and what I thought were important descriptors, like species, hair, and eye color. I also added a column for rank, so that my friends could fill out their own copies. This was a completely ridiculous activity that could only have been born out of quarantine boredom.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>star&lt;-star%&gt;%filter(gender==&quot;male&quot;)%&gt;% mutate(rank=&quot;&quot;,62)%&gt;%
  select(rank,name,species,homeworld,hair_color,eye_color)
mine&lt;-star%&gt;%mutate(rank=c(7,24,30,13,2,4,25,18,1,38,11,28,33,31,6,21,5,26,32,12,37,41,20,57,22,42,34,52,35,46,53,15,10,59,61,54,45,17,51,16,56,60,55,40,47,23,36,62,29,14,9,48,44,50,39,49,43,19,27,58,8,3))
mine &lt;- mine%&gt;%arrange(rank)%&gt;%select(rank,name)
names &lt;- mine%&gt;%select(name)
ranks &lt;- mine%&gt;%select(rank)</code></pre>
<p>I filled in all of my personal rankings on a printed out copy of the dataset, but that wasn’t good enough. The fact that my paper wasn’t arranged in ascending order really bothered me, so I proceeded to hard code all of my opinions into the rank column of the dataset. My friends met my ordered dataset with another round of heated debate.</p>
<p>That was the last of things until it came time for me to build this website. Using reticulate, I passed the lists of names and ranks that I created in R to a Python code chunk. This allowed me to make a cleaner string print out for this blog post.</p>
<p>I hope that anyone who comes across my portfolio will find my ridiculous use of R entertaining. Please enjoy my thoughts on the attractiveness of the males who lived a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for i in r.names:
    index = r.names.index(i)
    rank = r.ranks[index]
    print(&quot;#&quot;+rank+&quot; &quot;+i)</code></pre>
