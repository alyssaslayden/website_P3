This all started because of a very contentious debate about the attractiveness of various Star Wars characters. I decided to use the Star Wars dataset to settle things once and for all. I cleaned up the dataset, so that it just contained the male characters and what I thought were important descriptors, like species, hair, and eye color. I also added a column for rank, so that my friends could fill out their own copies. This was a completely ridiculous activity that could only have been born out of quarantine boredom.

```{R setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(dplyr)
star <- read.csv("starwars.csv")
```

```{r}
star<-star%>%filter(gender=="male")%>% mutate(rank="",62)%>%
  select(rank,name,species,homeworld,hair_color,eye_color)
mine<-star%>%mutate(rank=c(7,24,30,13,2,4,25,18,1,38,11,28,33,31,6,21,5,26,32,12,37,41,20,57,22,42,34,52,35,46,53,15,10,59,61,54,45,17,51,16,56,60,55,40,47,23,36,62,29,14,9,48,44,50,39,49,43,19,27,58,8,3))
mine <- mine%>%arrange(rank)%>%select(rank,name)
names <- mine%>%select(name)
ranks <- mine%>%select(rank)
```

I filled in all of my personal rankings on a printed out copy of the dataset, but that wasn't good enough. The fact that my paper wasn't arranged in ascending order really bothered me, so I proceeded to hard code all of my opinions into the rank column of the dataset. My friends met my ordered dataset with another round of heated debate. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
names <- list('Han Solo', 'Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'Poe Dameron', 'Anakin Skywalker', 'Lando Calrissian', 'Boba Fett', 'Luke Skywalker', 'Finn', 'Jango Fett', 'Darth Maul', 'Wedge Antilles', 'Arvel Crynyd', 'Biggs Darklighter', 'Bail Prestor Organa', 'Quarsh Panaka', 'Kit Fisto', 'Mace Windu', 'Chewbacca', 'Tarfful', 'Qui-Gon Jinn', 'Bossk', 'Finis Valorum', 'Gregar Typho', 'Darth Vader', 'Wilhuff Tarkin', 'Lobot', 'Raymus Antilles', 'Jek Tono Porkins', 'Dooku', 'Owen Lars', 'Palpatine', 'Ackbar', 'Yoda', 'Roos Tarpals', 'Ric Olie', 'Cliegg Lars', 'Wicket Systri Warrick', 'Greedo', 'Wat Tambor', 'Plo Koon', 'Nien Nunb', 'Jar Jar Binks', 'Grievous', 'Lama Su', 'Ben Quadinaros', 'Watto', 'Mas Amedda', 'Dexter Jettster', 'San Hill', 'Ratts Tyerell', 'Ki-Adi-Mundi', 'Rugor Nass', 'Sebulba', 'Gasgano', 'Yarael Poof', 'Eeth Koth', 'Nute Gunray', 'Tion Medon', 'Bib Fortuna', 'Saesee Tiin', 'Dud Bolt', 'Poggle the Lesser')
ranks <- list("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33","34","35","36","37","38","39","40","41","42","43","44","45","46","47","48","49","50","51","52","53","54","55","56","57","58","59","60","61","62")
```

That was the last of things until it came time for me to build this website. Using reticulate, I passed the lists of names and ranks that I created in R to a Python code chunk. This allowed me to make a cleaner string print out for this blog post.

I hope that anyone who comes across my portfolio will find my ridiculous use of R entertaining. Please enjoy my thoughts on the attractiveness of the males who lived a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.

```{python}
for i in r.names:
	index = r.names.index(i)
	rank = r.ranks[index]
	print("#"+rank+" "+i)
```

Note: For some reason, Kylo Ren was not in the dataset, but if he had been, he would have been ranked near the top.
